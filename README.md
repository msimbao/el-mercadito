# el-mercadito
A Digital Information Marketplace For Alight's Pedacito De La Tierra Shelters. This was a project made during the Mac Explore Challenge where teams were asked to build a possible solution for alights case study on helping families on the move better deal ncreased restrictions at the border.

The front facing part of the project is free to view at: [El-Mercadito](https://el-mercadito.glitch.me/)

## Description

Covid 19 and the Migration Protection Protocols have increased the hardships of families on the move, by augmenting immigration proceduresâ€™ delays and incertitude, while reducing safe shelters at the Mexican side of the US border.

Thanks to Alight and their partners such as the Catholic sisters, these vulnerable families are offered the protection they deserve: Pedacito de la Tierra, a place to rest and make decisions, a place to build community and restore their well being.

Building on this existing infrastructure and addressing the practical needs of these families, we are pleased to introduce an empowering platform: El Mercadito, an online and secure market place and message board, where families can share their needs, seek answers and propose their services, and be connected to shelters and support resources both locally and regionally.


### Measuring Impact

The simple way we tried to measure impact was by directly allowing users to tell us how useful the platform has been for them and what area of their life the information has played a positive role in.

We also collect usage statistics based on who needs information and who is offering information and hope to say that if the platform is growing then more and more people are finding it to be useful for their needs.

These are not perfect metrics but we hope they can give us some light into the impact the platform is having.

These are collected via sms commands explained in the usage section.

### Infrastructure

This system was built using Twilio as a communication API and Firebase as a cloud database. Entry is through two pathways, messaging or calling. if you message, you can leave feedback, get latest posts or make a post. If you call, you can make a post as a recording that will be transcribed by a moderator or by the google translate API. Translation is also available for sms messages through the google translate API. 

Below is an image showing the basic infrasturcture of the project, and the firebase and Twilio consoles.
